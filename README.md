# shopping-cart

Assignment for MIT xPRO course.

Using Strapi, we've created an api with elements that resemble various groceries. the "cart.jsx" file pulls from the api to give a shopping cart list, with the ability to add a certain number of items (whats in stock) and remove items from the cart. It will also give the total cost of all groceries.
